# Iris Dataset Prediction with BentoML

 This project demonstrates how to build, package, and serve a machine learning model for the classic Iris dataset prediction problem using BentoML. 
 The Iris dataset is widely used for classification tasks, and here we use it to predict the species of an iris flower based on its features 
 (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).

# Objectives

  Train a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

  Use BentoML to build a scalable, production-ready ML service.

  Serve the model via REST API for real-time predictions.
